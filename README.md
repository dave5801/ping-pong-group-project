# ping-pong-group-project

Pong Me.

Classrooms and Offices often have a ping-pong table located in a recreational lounge area.
Friendly competition is often how employees and classmates form friendships with one another.

Pong Me! is a project about connecting teammates through the sport of table tennis.

With friendly competition, of course.

Thanks to Slack, we can build a leaderBoard of all participating team members.
Classmates or co-workers are ranked according to skill level and participation.
Players can use the app to challenge each other.

Challenges will be issued by your team's slack channel.

Challenges may be answered with table and paddles.

This app maintains a leader board recording everyone's skill level.

...for all time.

Have fun!

Getting Started
----------------

Check out our app https://pong-me.herokuapp.com/

Sign up for Slack --> check out: https://slack.com/

Join your team's channel, or set one up... in case your teammates are completely anti-social :-)

Sign into our app with slack --> We have a button! Which we hope you can find. It's at the top of the screen.

Scroll down to see beginnings of greatness!

Your teammates should be visible.

You can challenge them by clicking the evil red button.
  --> I should not be making generalizations about buttons based on their color.
      (That's right I'm using a Github ReadMe as a platform for quirky social commentary)
  --> But seriously, it will send a challenge to your teammate via slack.
    --> Which must be answered!

For now...We trust each player to answer the results of each mach honestly.
  --> To do otherwise would be most uncool.
